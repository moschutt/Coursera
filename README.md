# Coursera courses

This repo contains work done for Coursera courses.  The first level represents
the university or author of the course.  Each course will have it's 
own folder and then be broken down as appropriate for the class within that.

I will attempt to provide summary notes of key concepts in the README.md in
each course sub-folder.
